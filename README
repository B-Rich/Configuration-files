Personal configuration files. (Who'd use someone else's configuration anyway?)

 - Safe 'rm' command with trash directory.
 - Shared history between Bash sessions (thanks Stack Overflow!).
 - Simple bookmarking system for Vim.
   * Supports 'foo' -> <file>:<pattern> mappings such
     that ':Go foo' jumps to the first line matching <pattern> in <file>.
 - Lots of Git helpers.
 - Helpers for inspecting compiler output and tracing file access.
 - Vim-like bindings and a simple, clean index for Mutt.
