libstdc++ debug info on Ubuntu 12.04 i386:

 * /usr/share/gcc-4.6/python or equivalent needs to be added to PYTHONPATH to
   get STL debugging working. Should be added to .profile so gVim picks it up.

 * libstdc++6-4.6-dbg only includes debug info and not the libstdc++ sources.
   Might need to get those from gcc-4.6.3.

   - Need to build libstdc++ to get source files in the right locations (in the
     build directory). The layout differs from that in the gcc source dir, and
     perhaps files are generated as well.

   - Install gcc-4.6.3 dependencies:
     $ sudo apt-get install libgmp3c2 libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev libc6-dev flex bison

   - Look into 'apt-get source' as an alternative. Might include patches, etc.

 * Need to map paths in libstdc++6-4.6-dbg's debug info to the source directory.
   Absolute paths can be fixed with 'set substitute-path'. How do you deal with
   relative paths?

   - Relative paths use per-object-file directory (DW_AT_comp_dir; see also DW_AT_name).

Debug info on Gentoo:

 * installsources, splitdebug
 * FEATURES=installsources, FEATURES=nostrip
 * /usr/debug
 * debugedit fixes up paths

File I/O optimization:

 * posix_fadvice and linked man pages

iostream types:

 * off_type is streamoff for char/wchar_t specializations. For example,
   basic_istream<char/wchar_t>::off_type =
     traits::off_type                    =
     char_traits<char/wchar_t>::off_type =
     streamoff

 * pos_type is either streampos or wstreampos by the same logic, but these
   are guaranteed to be the same by 27.2:

   - streampos = fpos<char_traits<char>::state_type> = fpos<mbstate_t>
   - wstreampos = fpos<char_traits<wchar_t>::state_type> = fpos<mbstate_t>

  Therefore, pos_type is fpos<mbstate_t>.

 * streamsize is basically ssize_t.

 * pos_type (fpos<mbstate_t>) can be offset by a streamoff (27.4.3.2). Two
   pos_type objects can be subtracted to get a streamoff.

 * streamsize and streamoff can be converted to each other. pos_type and
   off_type can be converted to each other.
