libstdc++ debug info on Ubuntu 12.04 i386:

 * /usr/share/gcc-4.6/python or equivalent needs to be added to PYTHONPATH to
   get STL debugging working. Should be added to .profile so gVim picks it up.

 * libstdc++6-4.6-dbg only includes debug info and not the libstdc++ sources.
   Might need to get those from gcc-4.6.3.

   - Need to build libstdc++ to get source files in the right locations (in the
     build directory). The layout differs from that in the gcc source dir, and
     perhaps files are generated as well.

   - Install gcc-4.6.3 dependencies:
     $ sudo apt-get install libgmp3c2 libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev libc6-dev flex bison

   - Look into 'apt-get source' as an alternative. Might include patches, etc.

 * Need to map paths in libstdc++6-4.6-dbg's debug info to the source directory.
   Absolute paths can be fixed with 'set substitute-path'. How do you deal with
   relative paths?

   - Relative paths use per-object-file directory (DW_AT_comp_dir; see also DW_AT_name).
